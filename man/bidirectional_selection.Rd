\usage{
bidirectional_selection(
  model,
  threshold = 0.15,
  addable_coefs = NULL,
  measure_fn = function(x) summary(x)[["coefficients"]][, 4],
  data = NULL,
  max_steps = 1000,
  return_step_results = FALSE,
  do_not_remove = c("(Intercept)")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model with [stats::update()] method.}

\item{threshold}{Value threshold to remove variable. where the variable is
removed if `measure_fn(model) > threshold`, added if `measure_fn(model) <= threshold`}

\item{addable_coefs}{Coefficients to try to add during forward step.}

\item{measure_fn}{Function with model as argument and returns values to be used by
`threshold`. It can also compare two models, where during forward step
it calls `measure_fn(candidate_model, current_selected_model)` and
during backward step it calls `measure_fn(current_selected_model, candidate_model)`.
Default is p-value reported by [summary()].}

\item{data}{Data to be used for model refit.}

\item{max_steps}{Maximum number of steps for selection.}

\item{return_step_results}{Boolean that if `TRUE` returns a list with the first
argument the selection result, and second argument a list with step, operation,
variable and its value.
`measure_fn` measures and coefficient removed.}

\item{do_not_remove}{String vector of variables to not be removed in the selection.}
}
\value{
the selected model if `return_step_results` is `False`.
